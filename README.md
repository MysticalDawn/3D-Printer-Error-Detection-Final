## Generalisable 3D Printing Error Detection and Correction Dataset

- **Title**: Generalisable 3D Printing Error Detection and Correction via Multi-Head Neural Networks
- **Authors**: Douglas Brion, Sebastian Pattinson
- **Repository URI**: [Cambridge Repository](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/339869)
- **Repository DOI**: [10.17863/CAM.84082](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.84082)

### Dataset Overview
This dataset contains **1,272,273** labelled images of the extrusion 3D printing process. It was collected using a camera mounted next to the nozzle of the printer, capturing images of material deposition for **192 different printed parts** across various geometries, material colors, and lighting conditions.

### Key Features
- **Labels**: Each image is labelled with:
  - Flow rate
  - Lateral speed
  - Z offset
  - Hotend temperature
  - Hotend target temperature
  - Bed temperature
  - Timestamp
  - Nozzle tip x and y coordinates

- **Filtered Dataset**: A CSV file containing **948,396** pre-filtered images is provided, where complete failures, parameter outliers, dark images, and images taken immediately after parameter changes have been removed.

### Data Collection
The data was generated on printers running Marlin 1.1.9 firmware and collected on a Python 3 server. Python was also used for sampling parameter combinations and cleaning/filtering the dataset after collection.
